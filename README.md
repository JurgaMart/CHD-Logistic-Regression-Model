# Logistic Regression Model for Predicting Coronary Heart Disease

## Task
The primary objective of this project is to develop a logistic regression model to predict the 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients using a dataset from the Framingham Heart Study. The project involves creating and interpreting the logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance using various metrics.

## Main Tools
The following tools and technologies were utilized in this project:
- **Gretl**: For conducting logistic regression analysis and calculating model coefficients.
- **Excel**: For data manipulation, calculating performance metrics, and creating confusion matrices.
- **Python**: For future enhancements and more comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building.

## Conclusions
Key findings from the logistic regression analysis include:
- **Significant Predictors**: Variables such as sex, age, total cholesterol, cigarettes per day, glucose levels, diastolic blood pressure, prevalent stroke, and prevalent hypertension were significant predictors of CHD.
- **Model Performance**: The model achieved an accuracy of 73% on the training set and 75% on the test set. The sensitivity was 49% on the training set and 60% on the test set, indicating the model's capability to identify true positive cases.
- **ROC Analysis**: The area under the ROC curve (AUC) suggested that the model had a reasonable predictive ability, though there is room for improvement.
- **Data Imbalance**: The dataset was imbalanced, with a higher proportion of non-CHD cases, which affected model performance. Undersampling was used to partially address this issue.

This logistic regression model can assist healthcare professionals in identifying patients at higher risk of developing CHD, allowing for timely preventive measures.
